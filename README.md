# Mario Kart Chart

“Mario Kart Chart” is a utility designed to help demystify the process of spec-ing out your racer in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The tech used is React, Redux, React Router, React Reveal, and Bootstrap (with a bit of custom CSS). The API was (painstakingly!) built by hand using the data from [this page](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_Deluxe_in-game_statistics) and all of the individual images were pulled from there as well.

The MVP will features landing home page, a page with dropdowns where you’ll assemble your racer, and a “Cart of Karts” to save all of your past assemblies. The main stretch goal will be the ability to redirect the user to a fourth page which will display their choices with a stat breakdown when clicking an assembly in the cart (I nixed this fourth page and just decided to do this in the cart without a separate page load). Animations would be a secondary stretch goal, as I’d like to learn a bit more about that.

In the words of our fine, mustachioed friend, “Let’s go!”
